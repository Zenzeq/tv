{"LongDescription":"Felicity for your Television. \n\nFelicity is a theme that takes everything great about iOS/tvOS icon design and pushes it further with brighter colours, sharper glyphs and deeper shadows.\n\nWhilst Felicity stays close to appleâ€™s original design, the changes it brings will provide a more pleasant and beautiful experience when using your devices. Get it now and try it out! \n\nFollow @xerusdesign on Twitter for updates!
