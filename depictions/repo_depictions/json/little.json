{"LongDescription":"When it comes to using an Apple TV, I get frustrated as soon as I see my home screen! \n\nIt’s just too boring seeing those flat glyphs and ugly gradients. That’s the reason I make themes, and that’s my main reason to jailbreak my devices. With that in mind, I’m glad to release my 11th project since I started back in 2010, this is Litt13 in honour of tvOS 13. \n\nThis fresh new look will give you a sense of innovation as every icon was every icon was designed uniquely in its own style.\n\nTry out Litt13 and explore how big this fantasy has become!","MainTextColor":"000000","BackgroundColor":"0066ff","BackgroundImageURL":"https://github.com/Zenzeq/tv/blob/main/depictions/repo_depictions/little/720x405bb.jpg","AppIconURL":"https://github.com/Zenzeq/tv/blob/main/depictions/repo_depictions/little/512x512bb.jpg","Screenshots":["https://github.com/Zenzeq/tv/blob/main/depictions/repo_depictions/Screenshots/little/720x405bb.jpg","https://github.com/Zenzeq/tv/blob/main/depictions/repo_depictions/Screenshots/little/720x405bb-1.jpg","https://github.com/Zenzeq/tv/blob/main/depictions/repo_depictions/Screenshots/little/720x405bb-2.jpg","https://github.com/Zenzeq/tv/blob/main/depictions/repo_depictions/Screenshots/little/720x405bb-3.jpg","https://github.com/Zenzeq/tv/blob/main/depictions/repo_depictions/Screenshots/little/720x405bb-4.jpg"]}
